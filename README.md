Overview
Welcome to the Code Translation Tool! In a landscape where translating code between programming languages is both frequent and complex, our tool stands out by automating the translation process while preserving code comments. This reduces errors, enhances productivity, and saves substantial time and cost for development teams.

Key Features
Automated Translation: Seamlessly translates code while preserving comments.
Contextual Accuracy: Maintains the functionality and idiomatic practices of the target language.
Error Detection: Integrated with IBM Watsonx for error detection and debugging.
Significant Time Savings: Reduces translation and debugging time from 50 hours to 7 hours.
Cost Efficiency: Saves approximately $2,150 per translation.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
API Credentials

Update app.py with your IBM Watsonx credentials in the get_credentials function.

Model Parameters

Configure the model parameters such as model_id, decoding_method, etc., in app.py.

Running the Application
Start Backend Server

From the backend directory, run:

bash
Copy code
python app.py

Example API Request
json
Copy code
POST /api/translate
{
  "sourceLanguage": "JavaScript",
  "targetLanguage": "Python",
  "sourceCode": "/* Sample JavaScript code */\nconsole.log('Hello World');"
}
Notes
Ensure that IBM Watsonx credentials and model parameters are correctly configured.
The reinsert_comments function in app.py is a placeholder and should be customized based on specific use cases.
